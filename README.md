BCG GAMMA is transforming the businesses of today through data science and analytics initiatives and our goal is to help companies generate competitive advantage through these initiatives.

Data science is a large market of opportunity and expertise within BCG and when tackling a business problem there are typically 5 high-level steps that we follow:

* Business understanding & problem framing: understanding the context of the customer and the problem they’re trying to solve with data
* Exploratory data analysis & data cleaning: understanding the customers' data and its statistical properties as well as preparing a dataset for further analysis
* Feature engineering: using business context and expertise to create new data that may provide useful signals in the prediction of outcomes
* Modeling and evaluation: Using your engineered dataset to model an outcome and generate predictions. Then, testing these predictions against the ground truth to see whether they are reliable.
* Insights & Recommendations: turning the insights of this analysis into business decisions and recommendations.
